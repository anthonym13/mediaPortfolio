<h2>About Me</h2>

<div class="writingcontent">
  <p>
    Hi, my name is Anthony Mirabito and I am from the East San Francisco Bay Area in California. I’m currently a Freshman at the University of Colorado Boulder.
  </p>
  <p>
    In High School, nearly all of my classes were focused on either STEM or Humanities. Aside from band, I have taken no art classes in school. I decided to take CMDP 1400 for a  new creative perspective on the world around us. I think that media dominates modern life and I want to learn what techniques creators use to appeal to the masses.
  </p>
  <p>
	  One key takeaway for me has been that consuming media is very active. Whether you’re listening to the radio or watching an experimental film, you must participate by asking questions and connecting the media to previous experiences. This sort of participation helps you engage with the media on a deeper level and better understand underlying messages.
