    <h1>New Media and Its Impact on Society</h1>

    <div class="writingcontent">
      <p>
        If I were to describe the way that we experience media art today in one word, it would be “Immersion.” Given our technologies - everything from surround sound speakers to VR headsets - we can become fully immersed in artificial environments. With old media, I think the most immersive experience one could have would be at a movie theater. In a dark room, with a big screen, and strong audio, it was the closest you could get to actually being present for the story. Today, you can be placed in the middle of the action and control your movements. This sort of experience can be incredibly realistic and freeing and adds endless possibilities to visual media.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are levels to this immersion. From role-playing video games to augmented reality apps to virtual reality chat rooms, consumers can choose just how far they want to go into a virtual world. For creators, there are many mediums to choose from. Gone are the days when 3-D just meant a sculpture. Artists can create 3-D models to exist in any virtual space or printed by anyone with a 3-D printer.
      </p>
      <p>
        With so many new tools, creators might be overwhelmed with their options. They must consider how their work will be viewed and experienced through every medium. In VR, there are a full three dimensions of space to cover. In music, artists must consider what kind of headphones listeners will use when streaming music on their smartphones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Media can also be produced rapidly and with better quality than ever before. One example is the trench run scene from “Star Wars: A New Hope.” What took George Lucas and his team weeks and months to model, film, and edit can be done in a day with modern software (there’s a great video on YouTube of this).
      </p>
      <p>
        The new burgeoning media ecosystem that we are living in has the potential to eliminate some of the biggest issues faced by artists in the past: time and money. There is no longer a need to spend thousands on high-tech camera equipment. Most smartphones have built-in cameras that are adequate for many projects. Dark rooms have been completely eliminated as a necessity by the invention of digital cameras. Video doesn’t take weeks to edit because you can instantly watch, replay, fastforward, cut, splice, delete, recover, and publish to the internet in minutes. And you can do it all on your smartphone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The media itself is immersive, but so is the landscape that it is creating. Everywhere you go there are people watching videos, listening to music, and creating their own media on their smartphones. You can live in a digital world, interacting with friends across the globe from you, and never leave your bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        We live in such an exciting time where so much is being created and discovered. The amount of content in existence is astronomical. On YouTube, more videos are uploaded in a day than you could watch in a lifetime. Collectively as a society, the possibilities are truly endless.
