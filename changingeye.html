    <h1>How my photography has changed this semester</h1>
    <div class="writingcontent">
      <p>
        I’ve never been taught photography before taking this class, and I’ve learned a lot this semester. I’ve always taken photos on my phone in my daily life, but the technique of photography is something new to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important thing that I learned this semester is color. I had never really considered the effect that color has on pictures, but in our photography unit, I learned about how light colors attract the eye. One of my first photos this semester is of my mother in the kitchen during lunch. It’s out of focus, dark, and the colors attract the eye to the messy counter and the windows instead of my mom.
        As I continued to take photos, I kept color in mind. While I was centering my subjects before, I also began to choose subjects that stood out in terms of color. My friends at dinner and the walking path covered in snow are good examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m very pleased with how my photography has improved, and I look forward to what I can capture in the future.
      </p>
