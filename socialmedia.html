    <h3>Why I chose TikTok</h3>

      <p>
        I chose TikTok as the platform for my social media short story. My main reason for using TikTok is that the app has a great text-to-speech feature that I thought would add a good comedic element to my story, and would also let me avoid recording my voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        TikTok has a number of other features that also helped immensely with this project. The main advantage is ease of use. TikTok is designed to help creators pump out content as fast as possible and it really shows when youâ€™re using the app. I also like the availability of music to be played over your videos (thanks Musical.ly).
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, TikTok is super easy to use and makes creating content very enjoyable.

    <h3>The process of drawing this picture</h3>

      <p>
        I suck at drawing. Pens and colored pencils were my only options.
