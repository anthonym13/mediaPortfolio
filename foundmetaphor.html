      <h3>The Production Process</h3>

      <p>
        I thoroughly enjoyed creating both the Found Footage and Metaphor of Self videos. I’ve made video edits on iMovie a few times before, and it’s a very satisfying process for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Found Footage project, I only chose videos from a famous YouTube playlist called “important videos.” I was first introduced to this playlist by a friend in middle school, and I think it’s very representative of 2010’s internet culture. I tried to emulate the meme compilation style of the time period (fast cuts between videos with absolutely no relation to each other) while heavily emphasizing two of my favorite videos from the playlist (“Yee” and “Terrible Mall Commercial”).
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Metaphor of Self project, I wanted to juxtapose two of my passions: the outdoors and spending time with friends and family. To help, I chose two of my favorite genres of music: classical and metal. I paired clips of nature with metal music, and classical with somewhat chaotic videos of my friends and family. I also cut the audio so that the songs were playing continuously throughout the video, so that some parts were skipped. I think this added a layer of continuity and randomness which helped convey my theme.

      <h3>Difficulties</h3>

      <p>
        I found the Metaphor of Self video to be much more difficult, mainly because I had to do a lot of filming. Giving the time constraints of the project, I thought it was hard to capture enough content that I thought could fit my concept. I could have added some found footage, but I wanted it to be 100% my own. In the end I didn’t really like my song choices, but even with an idea of what I wanted it was hard to find the right songs. (Also I got a copyright strike when I uploaded to YouTube which is why the video can’t be played within my site)
      </p>
      <p>
        Having an unlimited amount of content to choose from for the Found Footage project could have been an issue, but I had a clear idea of what I wanted to use going into the project.
