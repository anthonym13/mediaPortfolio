      <h3>About My Locative Media Project</h3>

      <p>
        For the Locative Media Project, I chose four audio clips that I recorded to give a new perspective on the Boulder Creek as a setting. Rather than depicting the creek as a peaceful environment (which it usually is), I chose to focus on the power of water.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first audio clip was recorded at dinner time in the Center for Community dining center on CU Main Campus. At lunch and dinner time on weekdays, the C4C is very busy. Much like the creek, there is constant noise. Although I haven’t experienced this myself, I am aware that Boulder Creek’s springtime flooding can raise water levels about 10 feet. I imagine that the noise is deafening, much like the C4C during dinner time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second clip is an excerpt from the book, “Make Your Bed” by Admiral William H. McRaven. This clip recounts the story of how Admiral McRaven reminded Suddam Hussein (after his capture) that he had lost his power. Although the creek is an unstoppable force, in the winter it loses much of its power and becomes less daunting.

      <h3>How Boulder Creek Represents Media Today</h3>

      <p>
        I think the creek is a very interesting setting to discuss space because it is a space that is constantly changing, just like media today. The creek is mostly fixed in its path, but over thousands of years it can change course, become wider, or even disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Media is the same way, although on a much smaller time frame. The way in which artists use space has drastically changed in even the last 10 years. Before, artists were mainly focused on static installations, oftentimes sitting in museums. Today, artists are creating works that move, change throughout the day, or require people to explore the outdoors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though it will remain mostly the same for hundreds of years, Boulder Creek represents a constantly changing media environment.
