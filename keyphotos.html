    <h1>Three Photos and How They Relate to Themes From This Year</h1>

    <div class="writingcontent">
      <p>
  	    My first photo is of my friend Owen eating at Boss Lady Pizza. The theme that this image represents is documentary subjects, more specifically informed consent and social actors. I had told Owen and my two other friends who we were eating with that I was going to take pictures for a school project (which was the Still Image Project at the time), but nobody knew that Owen would someday end up on my website. Also, eating pizza isn't particularly funny but Owen couldn’t keep a straight face as I took his picture.

        My second picture is from a football game at Folsom Field. This picture is representative of public media. Before Ralphie’s lap around the field, a video featuring Southpark’s Carmen plays on the big screen for everybody to see. The Southpark video is deployed to get the crowd excited about Ralphie, and is also a good allusion to the fact that the creators of Southpark are CU Alums.

        My last photo is a picture of Snapmaps from the social media app Snapchat. Snapmaps is an opt-in setting where users can allow Snapchat to update their location on a map shared with friends every time they open the app. This image is a good example of surveillance. The only purpose of opting-in for Snapmaps is to let your friends track your location. Despite it being somewhat creepy, most of my friends opt-in.
